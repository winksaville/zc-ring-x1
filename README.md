# zc-ring-x1

Zero copy ring buffer experiment 1

This is the main repo of a dual-repo convention for using
a bot to help develop a the code.

The beginnings of a tool to help is [vc-x1](https://github.com/winksaville/vc-x1)

## Releasing

**`cargo install` lockfile gotcha.** If you install your project's
binary with `cargo install --path .`, also pass `--locked`. By
default `cargo install` ignores `Cargo.lock` and re-resolves
dependencies from scratch, so it can silently build the binary from
a different — possibly broken — dependency graph than `cargo build`
/ `cargo test` ran against.

| command | reads `Cargo.lock`? | re-resolves? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo build` / `test` / `run`  | yes     | only if `Cargo.toml` changed |
| `cargo build --locked` (etc.)   | yes     | never; errors if it would need to |
| `cargo install` (default)       | **no**  | always, from scratch |
| `cargo install --locked`        | yes     | never; errors if it would need to |

There's no stable cargo config knob to make `--locked` the default
for `cargo install`, so the discipline lives in the per-commit cargo
cycle and shell aliases (e.g. `alias ci='cargo install --locked'`).

The trade-off is predictable-as-tested (`--locked`) vs picking up
upstream fixes via fresh resolves (default). Either is defensible —
pick what fits your project, then edit this section and the
per-commit cargo cycle to match. Background:
[cargo#7169](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7169),
[cargo#9436](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9436).

## jj Tips for Git Users

This project uses [Jujutsu (jj)](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/)
alongside git. New to jj? See
[Steve Klabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik)'s
[Jujutsu tutorial](https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial).

Repo-specific how-tos — initial commit, pushing, modifying and
force-pushing a commit, revsets, and a useful-commands reference —
live in [notes/jj-tips.md](notes/jj-tips.md).

## Cross-repo Linking with Git Trailers

Commits in each repo use [git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)
to cross-reference their counterpart in the other repo via an
`ochid` (Other Change ID) trailer — the defining mechanism of the
dual-repo convention. For the full definition — trailer syntax,
the example shape, per-commit mechanics, and `.vc-config.toml` —
see
[Cross-repo linking (ochid trailers)](AGENTS.md#cross-repo-linking-ochid-trailers).

## Contributing

Bot-following workflow, commit conventions, and code style are
canonical in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (which `CLAUDE.md` imports)
and [notes/cycle-protocol.md](notes/cycle-protocol.md):

- [Cycle numbering](notes/cycle-protocol.md#numbering) — the
  `X.Y.Z-N` phase-suffix convention (Preparation / Work /
  Close-out).
- [Commit description](notes/cycle-protocol.md#commit-description)
  — Conventional Commits + `(version)` suffix and per-repo body
  shape.
- [Per-commit flow](notes/cycle-protocol.md#per-commit-flow) —
  the cargo cycle plus the Work and Commit-Description review
  gates.
- [Code Conventions](AGENTS.md#code-conventions) — doc comments on
  every file / fn / method, `// OK: …` on `unwrap*` calls,
  ask-on-ambiguity, stuck detection.

Task tracking and release details live under [notes/](notes/):
near-term tasks in [notes/todo.md](notes/todo.md), per-release
details in `notes/chores/chores-*.md`, and notes-specific
formatting rules in [notes/README.md](notes/README.md).
